👋 Hi! I'm Amandeep Singh – I talk to computers and, surprisingly, they talk back. I've been charming React.js into doing my bidding, creating web apps that are as responsive as I am when someone mentions free food.

## 🎨 What I Do:

- I weave the mystical arts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into digital tapestries, convincing browsers to perform complex acrobatics with the power of React.js.
- I've been known to cast state management spells with Redux, making app states behave (most of the time).

## 📚 Currently Learning:


- Diving headfirst into the rabbit hole of SCSS and SASS because who needs CSS when you can have the functional power of SASS with almost the similar kind of syntax?
- I'm diving headfirst into the world of Jest, where the only thing being tested more than my code is my patience for debugging. Wish me luck – I'm going to need it. 🎭💻

## 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On:

- Projects that aim to solve the world's problems, one click event at a time.
- Open-source endeavors where I can sprinkle a little bit of my magic and learn a few new tricks from the wizards out there.

## 📫 Reach Out If:

- You need a React wizard or if you know the best place to get pizza. Seriously, I'm always looking for the ultimate pizza place.
🚀 Ready to make the web a more magical place, one component at a time.
